### LDDDL（Love's date and deadline）

Tell me a fairytale where love never ends,
Vows are kept, through seasons and trends.
Explain the date when love was kindled
Because it touched my heart to twiddle.

Till I deemed that you're the Mr. Right
When you sold everything just for my delight.
So, what is the love's date
If it weren't to open a gate.
What a shame, it...

Now I'm trapped in love's deadline
It means: "Love, Dead and Line".
"L" is not allowed to trans to "F", Fine
Just like the "M" left behind.
 
You never hurt me, you never cheated me,
And you never told me, what's everlasting.
Above love, above "YOUR" love.

Teeth trembling, because the tear
Tear welling up, then dropping somewhere?
 
So my cheek is hurt, so my heart is cheated
Thus I will be dead, in never-mind's night.

But hold on tight before silence claims—
See summer flowers burst into flames!
Before love's deadline seals its fate,
Let's seize our "date," before it's too late. 

And, I will never go
Just be with you, wherever we flow.
